# NF2024 Admin Website

This website is an website for administrators of Night Fiesta 2024 to use. Night Fiesta is a night version of open house
that is packed with interesting night activities and dazzling light installations. In Night Fiesta 2024, students each get
an rfid wristband and register their name at the administrative booths. They can then go around and use the bands at game
booths to gain points. There is a leaderboard on our main website showcasing the points of the people, intending to mimic
a carnival styled event. All this is stored in supabase(postgresql), where the schema has been made using Django framework.
